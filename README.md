# Predict Liver disease
This repository contains R code to find patterns and build models that can be used to
predict liver disease in a person. The data set used for analysis is available at [Kaggle Indian-Liver-Patients](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records).
The approach is to find any correlations among columns in the data set. At a high level, following steps are
performed to finalize a prediction model.
- Data Analysis: Inspect the data and perform any cleanup required.
- Data Visualization
- Feature selection
- Identify patterns and correlations
- Predict whether a patient has liver disease or not.

To use this code, download and run Analysis.R from your local machine. The code automatically pulls the .csv file from this repository/data directory to perform the analysis.
